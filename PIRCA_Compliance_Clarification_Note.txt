PIRCA Landing Page – Compliance Clarification Note

Item #8 in the compliance checklist reported a failure:
❌ ARIA role="button" not found.

Explanation:
This is a false negative. The HTML uses native <button> elements, which are inherently accessible and do not require an explicit role="button" attribute. According to WAI-ARIA specifications, adding ARIA roles to elements that already have built-in semantics is discouraged and unnecessary.

Resolution:
No changes are needed. This implementation is fully compliant with accessibility standards.

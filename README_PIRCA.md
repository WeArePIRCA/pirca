**PIRCA** is an independent, truth-driven initiative committed to exposing and resisting the incremental erosion of democratic norms, civil liberties, and institutional accountability. Through rigorous research, strategic digital tools, and public advocacy, PIRCA monitors authoritarian trends, decodes disinformation ecosystems, and equips the public with actionable intelligence.

## The DUB-O-TAKE Suite
PIRCA's flagship tools provide a modular framework for:

- **Signal-Skew Radar**: Detects narrative manipulation
- **Narrative Provenance Tracker**: Traces disinformation lineage
- **Public Disinfo Signature DB**: Archives propaganda patterns

**PIRCA is not a watchdog. It’s a firewall—built by people who believe that truth is not just a value, but a weapon of defense in a post-truth era.**
